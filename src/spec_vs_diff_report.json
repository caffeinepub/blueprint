  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be addressed by tightening demo-blueprint detection (using an allowlist set instead of an ID-prefix heuristic) and by adding/strengthening React Query invalidation/refetch behavior around blueprint purchase/ownership so Purchased can update without a hard refresh. The diff also includes additional unrelated changes (e.g., post/profile query behavior and documentation/state summaries) that were not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Expanded/modified non-blueprint query logic (e.g., user profile hooks and posts demo fallback logic) beyond what is necessary to fix purchased blueprints appearing.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically about blueprint demo-vs-real detection and Purchased tab refresh; changes shown include additional hooks and demo fallback behavior for posts/profiles not mentioned in requirements.",

      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-1/REQ-2; appears to be ancillary metadata/documentation change rather than implementing the specific purchased-blueprints fix.",
